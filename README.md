A type C project, kaggle competition project, aimed at building an accurate model predicting a building's energy usage. Creating accurate models will help with estimates and improve building efficiencies. Tasks completed in this project include exploring the data, preprocessing the data as necessary (e.g. look into combining the different datasets), determining the appropriate model type, creating a basic model, evaluating the model using the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error, and repeating the above steps with three different algorithms.
